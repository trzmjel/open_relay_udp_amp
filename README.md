# open_relay_udp_amp
This script allows users to scan networks for detecting Open Relay on SNMP, UDP Amplification on DNS and NTP.

##Educational purposes only! Use in you own pentest lab (will give docker files links for such in future, but basic DNS image, NTP server with MONLIST vulnerability and open relay server are good enough)
